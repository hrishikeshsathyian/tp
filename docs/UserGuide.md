## Feature-Details

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `new n/WEDDING_NAME`, you should replace `WEDDING_NAME` with the actual name, like `new n/John & Mary`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or simply as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be provided in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* The `DATE` Parameter has to be in the format `DDMMYYYY` 
  * e.g `25122025` for the 25th December 2025

* The `EMAIL` Parameter has to be a valid email address
    * e.g `e\hrishikeshsathyian2002@gmail.com`

* Special role tags to identify the bride and groom:
    * Use `t/bride` to designate a person as the bride
    * Use `t/groom` to designate a person as the groom
    * A wedding must have both a bride and groom to be valid
